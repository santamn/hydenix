## hydenix VM

If your system supports virtualization, you can try **hydenix in a NixOS VM** without installing it on your machine.

If you encounter issues running Hyprland inside the VM, see the [VirtIO guide](./faq.md#how-do-i-run-hyprland-in-a-vm).

```bash
# run the flake remotely
nix run github:santamn/hydenix
```

> [!NOTE]
> Any configuration changes require rebuilding the VM.
> To reset it, delete the disk image:
> ```text
> rm hydenix.qcow2
> ```
